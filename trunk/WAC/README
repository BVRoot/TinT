Please edit Makefile first before trying to build WAC.
Various paths and other configurable settings must be set before building.

This package requires the installation of several tools.
   1.  BUtils
   2.  mysql++  (which, in turn, requires mysql)
   3.  boost's regex module

There are a few other dependencies, but they are mostly perl-based and
should be part of a standard perl installation (like DBI).

This package does not create the database or the users.  This must be created separately
in accordance to the system administrator's wishes.

The mysql++ package must be built against the mysql system being used.
Note that the location of the mysql.h file might not be the same
on all systems!


In Makefile, note the locations of BUtils, mysql++, mysql.h, regex++, and the
installation location for WAC's library file, include files,
and everything else.

Some commands for building this system (in no particular order...):

 % make TheDirs

Note that this one has to be executed while logged onto the administration system
 % make TheAdmins


 % make TheListers

 % make WACmysql.cnf

 % make install


 % make clean

 % make remove
 % make uninstall

Individual programs can be indicated to rebuild just them.  For example:
 % make Sorter

or
 % make Load_Sorted_Data
