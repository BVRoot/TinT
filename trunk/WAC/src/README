To compile Load_Sorted_Data:
gcc Load_Sorted_Data.C -o $WAC_HOME/Commands/Load_Sorted_Data -L ~/usr/lib_ls2 -L /usr/lib/mysql -I /usr/local/mysql/include/mysql -l mysqlpp -l stdc++



To compile Load_Volume_Data:

Note that -O2 is the letter 'O' followed by a 2.  If you do not optimize these programs, this system will slow to a crawl!
Make sure that mysqlpp is installed on the system that you intend to run from.  Compile it against the server you will use,
so the paths indicated here may need to be difference for YOUR setup!  Always use the API the was compiled against the
server you will access.

Also, set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to your mysqlpp library and set CPATH to your mysqlpp includes.

As always with official Ben Root software, you will need CPATH to point to the UtlyFiles directory!
